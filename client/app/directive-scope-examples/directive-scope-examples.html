	<h3>Directives - Types of Scope</h3>
	<div>
		<p>This <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> box is linked to the controller's <code>parentVariable</code> variable.</p>
		<input ng-model="parentVariable" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
		<p>The three sections below are directives with the same content. They are constructed as children of the scope containing the <code>parentVariable</code>. They are all built with very similar HTML - an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> field and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> node that displays <code>parentVariable</code> in a different form, depending on the directive's <code>scope</code> attribute</p>

	<div class="row no-margin">
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<directive-scope-false class="directive-container"></directive-scope-false>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<directive-scope-true class="directive-container"></directive-scope-true>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-4">
			<directive-scope-controlled isolated-variable="parentVariable" class="directive-container"></directive-scope-controlled>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row no-margin small-margin--top">
		<p>For a detailed description of how each of them work, use the 'left' and 'right' button to look through the slides (which are conveniently stored inside a re-usable carousel directive). They try to explain the 3 concepts with an analogy of a child going to a nightclub and the parent wanting to know all of the details of what is going on inside the club.</p>
